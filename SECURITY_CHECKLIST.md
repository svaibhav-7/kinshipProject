- [ ] No API keys, passwords, or credentials in code
- [ ] No email addresses or phone numbers in commits
- [ ] No database connection strings or URLs
- [ ] No personal names in comments (except author attribution)

### ‚úÖ Dataset and Model Security
- [ ] Large model files (.pth, .h5) are in .gitignore
- [ ] Dataset directories (KinFaceW-I, KinFaceW-II) are excluded
- [ ] Personal images or test data are not included
- [ ] Pretrained model checkpoints are not committed
- [ ] BFM model files are excluded (licensing restrictions)

### ‚úÖ License Compliance
- [ ] All third-party licenses are properly documented
- [ ] MIT License applied to custom code
- [ ] Nvidia license restrictions acknowledged for nvdiffrast
- [ ] Dataset usage rights verified
- [ ] Commercial use restrictions noted where applicable

### ‚úÖ Attribution and Citations
- [ ] All papers and datasets properly cited
- [ ] README.md includes comprehensive attribution
- [ ] CITATIONS.md lists all academic references
- [ ] Original repository links provided
- [ ] Author acknowledgments included

### ‚úÖ Code Quality and Security
- [ ] No hardcoded file paths with personal information
- [ ] Input validation present in critical functions
- [ ] No debug prints with sensitive information
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive details
- [ ] Configuration files use environment variables

### ‚úÖ Repository Structure
- [ ] .gitignore properly configured
- [ ] README.md is comprehensive and clear
- [ ] LICENSE file includes third-party notices
- [ ] SECURITY.md provides security guidelines

## Critical Security Issues Found

### üö® HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Path Exposure**: Remove any references to `D:\SasiVaibhav\klu\3rd year\projects\`
2. **Personal Information**: Check for any personal identifiers in code comments
3. **Dataset Licensing**: Verify KinFaceW-II usage rights before including

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. **Model Files**: Ensure large pretrained models are properly excluded
2. **Test Data**: Remove any personal test images or data
3. **Configuration**: Use environment variables for any configuration

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Use relative paths throughout the codebase
2. Create setup scripts for dataset preparation
3. Document system requirements clearly
4. Provide clear installation instructions
5. Include contribution guidelines

## Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor for accidental commits of sensitive data
- [ ] Regular dependency updates for security patches
- [ ] Review access permissions if repository becomes popular
- [ ] Watch for issues related to misuse of biometric technology

## Emergency Procedures
If sensitive information is accidentally committed:
1. Immediately force-push to remove from history
2. Rotate any exposed credentials
3. Notify relevant parties if personal data was exposed
4. Consider making repository private temporarily

## Sign-off
