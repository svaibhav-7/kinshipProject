Kinship Verification Project
A comprehensive kinship verification system using Siamese neural networks with advanced feature extraction pipelines.

Overview
This project implements an end-to-end kinship verification system that leverages deep learning to determine biological relationships between individuals from facial images. The system combines feature-based approaches with Siamese neural network architectures to achieve robust kinship classification across multiple relationship types (Father-Son, Father-Daughter, Mother-Son, Mother-Daughter).

Key Features
Feature Extraction Pipeline: Advanced facial feature extraction using multiple methods including traditional computer vision techniques and deep learning-based approaches

Siamese Neural Network Architecture: Twin networks with shared weights for learning discriminative kinship features through metric learning

Multiple Relationship Classification: Supports verification of four primary kinship relationships (F-S, F-D, M-S, M-D)

Flexible Feature Modes:

Feature-Only Mode: Extract and utilize handcrafted or learned feature representations without 3D reconstruction

Hybrid Feature Integration: Combine multiple feature types for enhanced discrimination

Comprehensive Evaluation: Built-in metrics and visualization tools for model performance analysis

System Architecture
The kinship verification pipeline consists of several key components:

Preprocessing Module: Face detection, alignment, and normalization

Feature Extraction Module:

Traditional descriptors: LBP (Local Binary Patterns), HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), SIFT

Deep learning features: CNN-based feature extractors, pre-trained models (VGG-Face, ResNet)

Custom feature generators optimized for kinship signals

Siamese Network Training: Metric learning with contrastive loss or triplet loss functions

Classification Module: Final kinship decision using learned feature embeddings

Visualization Tools: Model performance analysis and result interpretation

Feature Extraction Methods
The system supports multiple feature extraction approaches:

Traditional Methods​
Local Binary Patterns (LBP): Texture-based descriptors capturing local facial patterns

Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): Edge and gradient-based features

Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT): Keypoint-based descriptors

Gabor Filters: Multi-scale and multi-orientation texture features

Deep Learning Methods​
VGG-Face: Pre-trained face recognition features

ResNet-50: Deep residual network features

Custom CNN: Kinship-optimized convolutional architectures

Vision Transformers: Self-attention based feature extraction (experimental)

Metric Learning​
The Siamese network employs metric learning to learn an optimal embedding space where:

Similar kinship pairs have small Euclidean distances

Non-kin pairs have large Euclidean distances

Two primary loss functions are supported:

Triplet Loss:​

text
L(A, P, N) = max(||f(A) - f(P)||² - ||f(A) - f(N)||² + margin, 0)
Where A is anchor, P is positive (kin), N is negative (non-kin)

Contrastive Loss:​

text
L = (1-Y) * (1/2) * D² + Y * (1/2) * max(margin - D, 0)²
Where Y indicates kin (1) or non-kin (0), D is embedding distance

Performance
The system has been evaluated on the KinFaceW-II dataset with competitive results across all kinship relationships. Performance metrics include:

Accuracy: Overall classification accuracy

F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

AUC-ROC: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve

Detailed performance results are available in combined_results/ after running evaluations.

Technical Details
Siamese Network Architecture​
The Siamese network consists of:

Twin CNNs: Two identical subnetworks with shared weights

Feature Embedding Layer: Projects images into learned feature space (typically 128 or 512 dimensions)

Distance Calculation: Computes similarity between embeddings (L1, L2, or cosine distance)

Classification Layer: Final kinship decision based on learned threshold

Training Strategy
Data Augmentation: Random crops, flips, color jittering to improve generalization

Hard Sample Mining: Focus on challenging negative pairs during training​

Batch Sampling: Balanced batches with equal positive and negative pairs

Learning Rate Scheduling: Cosine annealing or step decay

Early Stopping: Monitor validation performance to prevent overfitting
